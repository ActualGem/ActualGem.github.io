What is STDP?
======

Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a biological learning rule that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons based on the relative timing of their spikes. In simple terms, if neuron A fires just before neuron B, the connection between them is strengthened. Conversely, if neuron A fires after neuron B, the connection is weakened. This mechanism is thought to be a key component of how the brain learns and encodes information.

Aren't headings cool?
